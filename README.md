# NBA MVP Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the MVP of the National Basketball Association (NBA) using data scraped from [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and various Python packages such as `beautifulsoup4`, `pandas`, `requests`, and `selenium`.

## Getting Started

The first step in this project is to collect data from basketball-reference.com. This has already been done and the data is stored in a local file. The data has also been cleaned and combined into a single file with all relevant information. The next is to build the prediction model.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:
- beautifulsoup4
- pandas
- requests
- selenium

These packages can be installed using `pip` by running the following command:
    pip install beautifulsoup4 pandas requests selenium

## Next Steps (TODO)
- Building the prediction model

## Note
This is an ongoing project and the model is yet to be built.
